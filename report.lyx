Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Online gaming, and computer gaming in general has become an important part
 in many peoples day-to day lives.
 A few years ago, computer games were not at all as popular as they are
 today.
 With the advances in computer graphics and computer hardware today's games
 are much more sophisticated then they were in the days of 
\emph on
NetHack
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Zork, 
\emph default
or 
\emph on
Pacman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The early computer games featured simple, or no graphics at all 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "nethack:website"

\end_inset

.
 The games often took place in a textual world, leaving the task of picturing
 the world up to the player.
 Multi-player games were not as common as they are today, whereas most games
 today are expected to have a multi-player mode, most early games did not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since these early games, the gaming industry have become much more influential
 in many ways.
 Many advanced in computer hardware are thought to come from pressure from
 the computer game industry.
 More powerful games require more powerful, and more easily available hardware
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Drop a reference to the gaming industry pressuring more advanced hardware
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Due to the high entertainment value of modern computer games, gaming has
 become a huge industry, where large amounts of money are invested.
 The gaming industry is today, in some places even larger than the motion
 picture industry.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the increasing importance of computer gaming, more focus should be
 spent on improving the quality of the gaming service.
 As more and more computer games are gaining multi-player capabilities,
 the demands for multiplayer networking software rises.
 This thesis is about techniques for improving the quality if this networking
 software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reliable generic game server, hereafter known as GGS, is a computer
 program designed to 
\emph on
host
\emph default
 network games on one or more server computers.
 Hosting, in a network software setting, means allowing client software
 connect to the server software, for the purpose of utilizing services provided
 by the server.
 The GGS software provides games as a service, and the clients connecting
 to the GGS can play these games on the GGS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of game servers is not new, network games have been played for
 decades.
 Early, popular examples of network games include the 
\emph on
Quake
\emph default
 series, or the 
\emph on
Doom
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\emph on

\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph default
 games.
 Newer examples of network games include 
\emph on
World of Warcraft
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
Counter-Strike
\emph default
.
 The difference between the GGS and the servers for these games is that
 the servers for Doom, Quake, and the others listed, were designed with
 these specific games in mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What GGS does is to provide a 
\emph on
generic
\emph default
 framework for developing network games.
 The framework is generic in the sense that it is not bound to a specific
 game.
 There are many different types of games, some are inheritly more time sensitive
 than others, strategy games are examples of games which are not very sensitive
 to time delays, first-person shooters however, can be very sensitive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The generic nature of the GGS allows the creation of many different types
 of games, the motivation behind this is to remove the neccessity of writing
 new game servers when developing new games.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GGS is in addition to being generic, also 
\emph on
reliable
\emph default
 in the sense that the gaming service provided is consistant and available.
 A consistant and available server is a server that handles hardware failiures
 and software failiures gracefully.
 In the event of a component breaking within the GGS, the error is handled
 by fault recovery processes, thereby creating a more reliable system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Background 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The game industry is a quickly growing industry where the need for new technique
s is large.
 One specific section where the development has stalled is the game server
 section.
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 The existing game servers are functional but they lack good fault tolerance
 and the ability to scale well
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Users will notice this in low uptime and many crashes.
 This is a problem that has existed and been resolved in other industries.
 In the telecom industry solutins to similar problems have been found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common figure often used in telecoms is that of 
\emph on
the nine nines
\emph default
, referring to 
\begin_inset Formula $99.999999999\%$
\end_inset

 of availability, or rougly 
\begin_inset Formula $15ms$
\end_inset

 downtime in a year.
 The level of instability and bad fault tolerance seen in the game server
 industry would not have been accepted in the telecoms industry.
 This level of instability should not be accepted in the game server industry
 either.
 An unavailabvle phone system could potentially have life threatening consequenc
es, leaving the public unable to contant emergency services.
 The same can not be said about an unavailable game server.
 The statement that game servers are less important than phone systems is
 not a reason not to draw wisdom from what the telecoms have already learnt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving back to the gaming industry.
 The main reason to develop reliable servers are monetary, it is important
 for game companies to expand its customer base.
 Reliable game servers are one improvement that will create a good image
 of a company.
 In general the downtime of game servers is much higher than the downtime
 of telecom system 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The structure of the system is similar in many ways and it should be possible
 to reuse solutions from the telecom system to improve game servers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the current state game servers are developed on a per-game basis, in
 many cases this seems like a bad solution.
 Developers of network game need to understand network programming.
 A way to change this is a generic game server which give the game developers
 a server which they implement their game towards.
 This approach would not only make it easier to develop network games, it
 would also allow games in different programming languages to be implemented
 using the same server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some factors key to the development of GGS have been isolated.
 Many of these come from the telecom sector.
 The factors are 
\emph on
scalability, fault tolerance 
\emph default
and being 
\emph on
generic
\emph default
.
 These terms are defined below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scalability (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Scalability"

\end_inset

) in computer science is a large topic and is commonly divided into sub-fields,
 two of which are 
\emph on
structural scalability
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
load scalability
\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bondi:2000:CSI:350391.350432"

\end_inset

.
 These two issues are addressed in this thesis.
 Structural scalability means expanding an architecture, e.g.
 adding nodes to a system without requiring modification of the system.
 Load scalability means using the available resources in a way which allows
 handling increasing load, e.g more users, gracefully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fault tolerance (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Fault-Tolerance"

\end_inset

) is used to raise the level of 
\emph on
dependability
\emph default
 in a system, so that the dependability is high even in presence of errors.
 Dependability is defined as the statistical probability of the system functioni
ng as intended at a given point in time.
 Fault tolerance is defined as the property of a system to always follow
 a specification, even in the presence of errors.
 The specification could take the form of error handling procedures which
 activate when an error occurs.
 This means that a fault tolerant, dependable system, will have a very high
 probability of functioning at a given point in time, and is exactly what
 is desired.

\begin_layout Standard
A generic (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Generic"

\end_inset

) game server has to be able to run different client-server network games
 regardless of the platform the clients are running on.
 It runs network games of different type.
 A very rough separation of games is real time games and turn based games.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The server behaves in a way similar to an application server, but is designed
 to help running games.
 An application server provides processing ability and time, therefore it
 is different from a file- or print-server, which only serves resources
 to the clients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common type of application servers are web servers, where you run
 a web application within the server.
 The application server provides an environment and interfaces to the outer
 world, in which applications run.
 Hooks and helpers are provided to use the resources of the server.
 Some examples for web application servers are the 
\emph on
Glassfish
\emph default
 server which allows running applications written in Java or the 
\emph on
Google App Engine
\emph default
 where you can run applications written in Python or some language which
 runs in the 
\emph on
Java Virtual Machine
\emph default
.
 An example of an application server not powering web applications, but
 instead regular business logic, is Oracle’s 
\emph on
TUXEDO
\emph default
 application server, which can be used to run applications written in COBOL,
 C++ and other languages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A database server can also be seen as an application server.
 Scripts, for example SQL queries or JavaScript, are sent to the server,
 which runs them and returns the evaluated data to the clients.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the purposes of this thesis is to investigate how we can make a game
 server as generic as possible.
 Some important helpers are discussed, such as abstraction of the network
 layer, data store and game specific features.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an aid in discussing the theoretical parts of the GGS a prototype has
 been developed.
 The prototype does not feature all of the characteristics described in
 this thesis.
 A selection has been made among the features, and the most important ones
 have been implemented either full or in part in the prototype.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The choice of implementation language for the prototype of the GGS was made
 with inspiration from the telecom industry.
 The Erlang language was developed by the telecom company Ericsson to develop
 highly available and dependable telecom switches.
 One of the most reliable systems ever developed by Ericsson, the AXD301
 was developed using Erlang.
 The AXD301 is also possibly has the largest code base even written in a
 functional language 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 The same language is used to develop the prototype of the GGS.
 Usage of Erlang in the GGS is discussed in further detail in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Section
Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The purpose of the GGS project.
 What is the purpose of creating a fault tolerant server, why is it generic,
 and what good does it do to have a scalable system? In the background,
 we should give the motivations behind creating this software, but here
 we should outline why the software is needed.
 This section should be shortened, and the bulk of the text should be moved
 to theory or background.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of creating a generic and fault tolerant game server is to provide
 a good framework for the development of many different types of games.
 Allowing the system to scale up and down is a powerful way to maximize
 the usage of physical resources.
 By scaling up to new machines when load increases, and scaling down from
 machines when load decreases costs and energy consumption can be optimized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fault tolerance is important for the GGS in order to create a reliable service.
 The purpose of a reliable game server is to provide a consistant service
 to people using the server.
 Going back to the telecom example, the purpose of creating a reliable telecom
 system is to allow calls, possibly emergency calls, at any time.
 Should the telecom network be unavailable at any time, emergency services
 may become unavailable, furthermore the consumer image of the telecom system
 degrades.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Returning to the game industry, emergency services will not be contacted
 using a game server, however an unavailable server will degrade the consumer
 image of the system.
 Consider an online casino company.
 The online casino company's servers must be available at all times to allow
 customers to play.
 If the servers are unavailable, customers can not play, and the company
 loses money.
 In this scenario, an unavailable server can be compared to a closed real-world
 casino.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Challenges in developing the prototype
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word 
\emph on
generic
\emph default
 in the name of the GGS implies that the system is able to run a very broad
 range of different code, for instance code written in different programming
 languages, in addition to a broad range of different game types.
 In order to support this, a virtual machine (VM) for each 
\emph on
game development language
\emph default
 (hereafter GDL for brevity) is used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No hard limit has been set on which languages can be used for game development
 on the GGS, but there are several factors which decide the feasibility
 of a language:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How well it integrates with Erlang, which is used in the core the GGS system
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How easy it is to send messages to the virtual machine of the GDL from the
 GGS 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How easy it is to send messages from the GDL VM to the GGS
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Add more like threads, events, etc.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Internally, the GDL VM needs to interface with the GGS to make use of the
 helpers and tools that the GGS provides.
 Thus an internal API has to be designed for use in interacting with the
 GGS.
 This API is ideally completely independent of the GDL, and reusable for
 any GDL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The communication with gaming clients has to take place over a protocol.
 Ideally a standard protocol should be used, in order to shorten the learning
 curve for developers, and also make the system as a whole less obscure.
 A large challenge during this project is to decide whether an existing
 protocol can be used, and if not, how a new protocol can be designed which
 performs technically as desired, while still being familiar enough to existing
 developers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A great deal of work is devoted to make the GGS 
\emph on
reliable
\emph default
.
 This includes ensuring that the system scales well, and to make sure it
 is fault tolerant.
 In order to facilitate scalability, we need a storage platform which is
 accessible and consistent among all of the GGS, this is also investigated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Limitations of the prototype
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implementation of the GGS protocol, together with storage possibilities,
 server capacity, and game language support imposes some limitations on
 the project.
 To get a functional prototype some limits must be set on the types games
 that can be played on the prototype.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The UDP protocol is not supported for communication between client and server.
 The TCP protocol was chosen in favour of UDP, due to the fact that the
 implementation process using TCP was faster than if UDP would have been
 used.
 UDP is generally considered to be faster than TCP for the transfer of game
 (and other) related data, this is discussed in more depth in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Choice-of-network"

\end_inset

.
 In short, the decision of using TCP means that games that requires a high
 speed protocol will not be supported by the GGS prototype.
 Another limitation necessary to set on the system is the possibility to
 have huge game worlds due to the implementation of the scaling mechanism
 in the prototype.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In real time games all players are playing together at the same time.
 Latency is a huge problem in real time games, a typical round trip time
 for such games is one of 
\begin_inset Formula $50$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $150ms$
\end_inset

 and everything above 
\begin_inset Formula $200ms$
\end_inset

 is reported to be intolerable 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Farber:2002:NGT:566500.566508"

\end_inset

.
 Latency sensitive games include most of the first person shooters with
 multiplayer ability, for example 
\emph on
Counter Strike
\emph default
 or massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPG:s), for example
 
\emph on
World of Warcraft
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In turn based games each player has to wait for their turn.
 Latency is not a problem since the gameplay does not require fast interactions
 between the players, long round trip times will not be noticed.
 Examples of turn based games include board and card games, as well as multiplay
er games like 
\emph on
Jeopardy
\emph default
.
 Both game types have varying difficulties and needs when it comes to implementi
ng them, a Generic Game Server should address all of them and help the developer
 to accomplish his goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the limited capability of threading in many GDL VM:s, the GGS prototype
 will not support MMORPG:s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implementation of the GGS described in this thesis is only a small prototype
 and tests will be performed on simple games like pong or chess, thus there
 are no need to implement more advanced features in the system.
 It is important to note that these limitations only apply for the prototype
 of the project, and that further developments to the GGS could be to implement
 these features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Development process 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A prototype was developed early on in the project in order to carry out
 experiments.
 Using this prototype, the system was divided into modules.
 A demand specification was created, using this specification, the modules
 were easily identifiable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first prototype of the GGS consisted of simple modules, however, due
 to the separation of concerns between the modules, they were easily independant
ly modified and improved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the basic structure of the GGS had been established, the first prototype
 was removed, remaining was the structure of the modules and the internal
 flow of the application.
 This could be seen as an interative workflow, with the first prototype
 being the first iteration.
 The second iteration later became the final result of the GGS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The layout of the GGS is both layered and modular.
 The first layer handles the most primitive data and produces a higher level
 representation of the data, passing it along to different modules of the
 GGS.
 The modular structure of the GGS plays an important role in making the
 system fault tolerant.
 The approach to fault tolerance is by replication, and restarting faulting
 modules with the last known good data.

 in the computer software world, in order to understand complex problems
 more easily.
 While there may not always be a real world example of a system performing
 th exact duties of the system being modelled in the computer, it is often
 easier to create and analyze requirements for real world systems and processes
 than systems existing soley in a computer.
 The requirements and limitations imposed on the real-world system can,
 using the proper tools, be transferred in to the software.

 - a building where chess players can meet and play chess.
 Since a real-world scenario is readily available, and to such a large extent
 resembles the computer software required for the GGS, the next step in
 developing the GGS system is to duplicate this real world scenario in a
 software setting.

 Several buildings linked together would represent a cluster of GGS instances.
 In order for a player (the P symbol in the graphic) to enter the theoretical

 can be kept, ensuring that there are not too many players within the building.
 In the GGS setting, too many players entering would mean too many connections
 have been accepted to the GGS system, and that the structure of the system
 thus must be modified, adding additional servers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a player has been allowed in to the chess club the player is greeted
 by the host of the chess club, in the GGS setting represented by the 
\emph on

\emph default
, and is seated by a table.
 The coordinator keeps track of all the players in the building, and all
 moved made by the players.
 The information available to the coordinator means that cheating can be
 monitored and book keeping can be performed by this entity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moves by players are made using the tables present in the chess club.
 Every game is isolated to a table, just as expected.
 This means that communication during a game only has to pass by the players
 of that particular game, and the coordinator, making sure that no cheating
 takes place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This isolation of the games plays an imporant part in many properties of
 the GGS, the isolation means that games can for example be transferred
 between different chess clubs, furthermore, if cheating takes place, corruption
 can only occur in the particular table where it was found, and can not
 spread.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving chess players from one location to another is one of the alterations
 made to the real world chess club system to make the system more appropriate
 for a software setting.
 Allowing games to be transferred is not a property usually desired in a
 real world chess club, where transferring players would mean moving the
 players from one building to another.
 In the software setting, moving players means moving the game processes
 from one system to another, perhaps to balance the system load.
 This transfer of players can occur transparently, without notifying the
 players.

Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many ways in which performance could be measured.
 For the clients, time and response times are useful measurements in time
 critical settings.
 In non-time critical settings, the reliability of message delivery may
 be an even more important factor than speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a first person shooter game, the speed of delivery of messages is essential.
 Failiure to deliver messages in time results in choppy gameplay for the
 players.
 In strategy games, the reliability of delivery may be more important than
 the speed, since the game is not percieved as choppy even if the messages
 are delayed.

Choice of network protocol
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Choice-of-network"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three main ways in which computer communication over the Internet
 usually takes place; TCP, UDP and HTTP.
 The first two are transport layer protocols, which are commonly used to
 transport application layer protocols, such as HTTP.
 TCP and UDP can not be used on their own, without an application layer
 protocol on top.
 Application layer protocols such as HTTP on the other hand needs a transport
 layer protocol in order to work.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
HTTP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since HTTP is so widely used on the Internet today in web servers, it is
 available on most Internet connected devices.
 This means that if HTTP is used in the GGS, firewalls will not pose problems,
 which is a great benefit.
 However, due to the intended usage of HTTP in web servers, the protocol
 was designed to be stateless and client-initiated.
 In order to maintain a state during a game session using HTTP, some sort
 of token would have to be passed between client and server at all times,
 much like how a web server works.
 These facts combined makes HTTP unsuitable for our purposes, since the
 GGS requires a state to be maintained throughout a session, and also needs
 to push data from the server to clients without the clients requesting
 data.
 It should also be mentioned that HTTP uses the TCP protocol for transport,
 and what is said about TCP also applies to HTTP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
UDP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many online games use UDP as the carrier for their application layer protocol.
 UDP moves data across a network very quickly, however it does not ensure
 that the data transferred arrives in consistent manner.
 Data sent via UDP may be repeated, lost or out of order.
 To ensure the data transferred is in good shape, some sort of error checking
 mechanisms must be implemented.
 UDP is a good choice for applications where it is more important that data
 arrives in a timely manner than that all data arrives undamaged, it is
 thus very suitable for media streaming, for example.
 In the GGS reliability of transfer was chosen before the speed of the transfer,
 ruling out UDP as the transport later protocol.
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Perhaps we should only say that we chose TCP just for our GGS prototype
 and why.
 If we leave it like that it seems that we think it is not suitable.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
TCP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For reliable transfers, TCP is often used on the Internet.
 Built in to the protocol are the error checking and correction mechanisms
 missing in UDP.
 This ensures the consistency of data, but also makes the transfer slower
 than if UDP had been used.
 In the GGS, data consistency is more important than transfer speeds, and
 thus TCP is a better alternative than UDP.
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Same here it is simply not true for a generic server to chose one or the
 other.
 We should rephrase it so it is clear that we only state it about the GGS
 prototype.

Fault Tolerance
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Fault-Tolerance"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fault tolerance is an important factor in all servers, a server that is
 fault tolerant should be able to follow a given specification when parts
 of the system failures.
 This means that fault tolerance is different in each system depending on
 what specification they have.
 A system could be fault tolerant in different aspects, one is where the
 system is guaranteed to be available but not safe and it could also be
 reversed, that the system is safe but not guaranteed to be available.
 Depending on the system one property may be more important(some example
 here).
 A system could also have non existent fault tolerance or it could be both
 safe and guaranteed to be available.
 It should be noted that it is not possible to achieve complete fault tolerance,
 a system will always have a certain risk of failure.
 With this in mind the goal is to make the GGS prototype as fault tolerant
 as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to make the GGS prototype fault tolerant the programming language
 Erlang has been used.
 Erlang will not guarantee a fault tolerant system but it has features that
 support and encourage the development of fault tolerant systems.
 In the GGS it is important that the system overall is fault tolerant.
 Crashes of the whole system should be avoided as this would make the system
 unusable for a time.
 By using supervisor structures it is possible to crash and restart small
 parts of the system, this is convenient as fault can be handled within
 small modules thus never forcing a crash of the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The need for fault tolerance in game servers is not as obvious as it may
 be for other typ of servers.
 In general all servers strive to be fault tolerant as fault tolerance means
 more uptime and a safer system.
 This applies to game servers aswell, in brief good fault tolerance is a
 way of satisfying customers.
 In general, game servers differ from many other fault tolerant systems
 in that high-availability is more important than the safety of the system.
 For example a simple calculation error will not be critical for a game
 server but it may be in a life-critical system and then it is better that
 the system crashes than works with the faulty data.
 There are cases where safety may be critical in game servers, one example
 is in games where in-game money exist.

One important factor of any server is the availability.
 A server to which you are unable to connect to is a useless server.
 Other then within telecomunication, their uptime is of about 99,9999999%,
 the game developer community hasn't approched this problem very genuinely
 yet so there is much room for improvement.

 but for the GGS a different approach has been chosen.
 Instead of just duplicating a virtual machine, the programming language
 Erlang has been used which offers several features to increase the availability.
 Some of them are 
\emph on

\begin_layout Section
Scalability
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Scalability"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each instance of the GGS contains several tables.
 Each table is an isolated instance of a game, for example a chess game
 or a poker game.
 The way that the GGS scales is to distribute these tables on different
 servers.
 In many games it is not necessary for a player to move between tables during
 games.
 This is for example not a common occurrence in chess, where it would be
 represented as a player standing up from her current table and sitting
 down at a new table, all within the same game session.
 With this in mind, the main focus of the GGS is not to move players between
 tables, but to keep a player in a table, and to start new tables instead.
 When a server has reached a certain amount of players the performance will
 start to decrease.
 To avoid this the GGS will start new tables on another server, using this
 technique the players will be close to evenly distributed between the servers.
 It is important to investigate and find out how many players that are optimal
 for each server.
 This approach makes it possible to utilize all resources with moderate
 load, instead of having some resources with heavy load and some with almost
 no load.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in the purpose section there are two different types of scalability
, structural scalability and load scalability.
 To make the GGS scalable both types of scalability are needed.
 Structural scalability means in our case that it should be possible to
 add more servers to an existing cluster of servers.
 By adding more servers the limits of how many users a system can have is
 increased.
 Load scalability in contrast to structural scalability is not about how
 to increase the actual limits of the system.
 Instead it means how good the system handles increased load.
 The GGS should be able to scale well in both categories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Load balancing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The need for load balancing varies between different kind of systems.
 Small systems that only use one or a couple of servers can cope with a
 simple implementation of it, while in large systems it is critical to have
 extensive and well working load balancing.
 The need also depends on what kind of server structure that the system
 works on.
 A static structure where the number of servers are predefined or a dynamic
 structure where the number varies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Load balancing and scaling is difficult in different scenarios.
 When running in a separate server park, there are a set number of servers
 available, this means that an even distribution on all servers is preferable.
 When running the GGS in a cloud, such as Amazon EC2, it is possible to
 add an almost infinite number of servers as execution goes on.
 In this cloud setting, it may be more important to evenly distribute load
 on newly added servers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two methods of balancing load (increasing structure):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fill up the capacity of one server completely, and then move over to the
 next server 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Evenly distribute all clients to all servers from the beginning, when load
 becomes too high on all of them, then comes a new problem: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
How do we distribute load on these new servers?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Load balancing is a key component to achieve scalability in network systems.
 The GGS is a good example of a system that needs to be scalable, to attain
 this load balancing is necessary.
 Optimization of the load balancing for a system is an important task to
 provide a stable and fast load balancer.
 There are certain persistence problems that can occur with load balancing,
 if a player moves from a server to another data loss may occur.
 This is an important aspect to consider when the load balancer is designed
 and implemented.

Because P2P game architectures are a constant goal for cheaters and because
 “Cheating is a major concern in network games as it degrades the experience
 of the majority of players who are honest” and preventing cheating in P2P
 game architectures is very difficult game developers try to use Client
 - Server architectures which have a natural problem to scale.
 In this paper we want to show some strategies to achieve scalability.

 When players communicate amongst each other, or communicate with tables,
 they need to be able to uniquely identify all of these resources.
 Within one machine, this is mostly not a problem.
 A simple system with a counter can be imagined, where each request for
 a new ID increments the previous identifier and returns the new identifier
 based off the old one, see algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:A-simple-generator"

\end_inset

.
 This solution poses problems when dealing with concurrent and distributed
 systems.
 In concurrent systems, the simple solution in algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:A-simple-generator"

\end_inset

 may yield non-unique identifiers due to the lack of mutual exclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The obvious solution to this problem is to ensure mutual exclusion by using
 some sort of lock, which may work well in many concurrent systems.
 In a distributed system, this lock, along with the state, would have to
 be distributed.
 If the lock is not distributed, no guarantee can be made that two nodes
 in the distributed system do not generate the same number.
 A different approach is to give each node the ability to generate Universally
 Unique Identifiers (UUID), where the state of one machine does not interfere
 with the state of another.

 This is accomplished by gathering several different sources of information,

Security

\begin_layout Standard
We only support languages running in a sandboxed environment.
 Each game session is started in its own sandbox.
 The sandboxing isolates the games in such a way that they can not interfere
 with each other.
 If sandboxing was not in place, one game could potentially modify the contents
 of a different game.
 A similar approach is taken with the persistent storage we provide.
 In the storage each game has its own namespace, much like a table in a
 relational database.
 A game is not allowed to venture outside this namespace, and can because
 of this not modify the persistent data of other games.

Overview of the prototype
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prototype of the GGS was developed using the Erlang language.
 The functional and concurrent style of Erlang facilitates devlopment of
 software based on a real-world model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 In Erlang, most things are processes.
 The software running the Erlang code is known as the Erlang machine, or
 an Erlang node.
 Each Erlang node is capable of running several 
\emph on
threads 
\emph default
(also known as 
\emph on
Light Weight Processes; LWP
\emph default
)
\emph on
, 
\emph default
much like the threads in an operating system.
 Threads in a Linux system, for example, are treated much like operating
 system processes in different systems.
 Due to the size of datastructures related to each process, swapping one
 process for another (known as 
\emph on
context switching
\emph default
) is an expensive task in many systems.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cost of swapping operating system processes becomes a problem when many
 processes are involved.
 If the GGS system had been developed using regular operating system processes,
 it would have had to be designed in a way to minimize the number of processes.
 Using Erlang, which is capable of running very many processes, several
 times more than an operating system can, the mapping between the real world
 system (described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Design-of-the"

\end_inset

) becomes clearer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Erlang allows the GGS to create several process for each player connecting,
 these processes can handle a multitude of different tasks, parsing data
 for example.
 Since each task is handled by a different process, the tasks are clearly
 separated and the failiure of one is easily recovered without affecting
 the others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to creating (or 
\emph on
spawning
\emph default
) processes specifically to handle new players connecting, the GGS has more
 permanent processes running at all times.
 The constantly running processes in the GGS system are called 
\emph on
modules
\emph default
.
 An example of a module in the GGS is the 
\emph on
dispatcher module
\emph default
, which handles the initial connection made by a client, passing the connection
 along further in to the system.

The usage of Erlang in the GGS
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Erlang was designed by Ericsson, beginning in 1986, for the purpose of creating
 concurrent applications and improving telecom software.
 Features essential for the telecom instustry to achieve high availability
 in telecom switches were added to the language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Erlang uses message passing in favour of shared memory, mutextes and locks,
 something which at the time was controversial among fellow developers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Armstrong:2010:ERL:1810891.1810910"

\end_inset

.
 The reason for using message passing, according to Armstrong, was that
 applications should operate correctly before optimizations are done, where
 efficient internal communication within the Erlang machine was considered
 a later optimization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In using message passing in favour of the methods commonly used at the time,
 the issues commonly associated with shared memory and locking were avoided.
 In Erlang, everything is a process, and everything operates in its own
 memory space.
 Memory can not be shared among processes, which prohibits a process from
 corrupting the memory of a different process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Messages are sent between the processes in an asynchronous manner, and each
 process has a mailbox in which these messages can be retrieved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Processes in Erlang are also called 
\emph on
Light Weight Processes.
 
\emph default
The Erlang processes are very cheaply created.
 Processes exist within an Erlang machine, or Erlang node.
 The Erlang machine has its own scheduler and does not rely on the operating
 system's scheduler, this is a main reason of Erlang's capability of running
 many concurrent processes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strong isolation of Erlang processes make them ideal for multicore and
 distributed systems.
 Distribution of software is included as a fundamental part in the Erlang
 language.
 The 'physical' location of a process, e.g.
 which computer the process runs on, is not important when communicating
 with the process.
 Processes can communicate regardless of whether they run on the same system
 of not, transparently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distributed nature of Erlang is something the GGS makes use of when
 scaling across several computers in order to achieve higher performance.
 The distribution is also important in creating redundancy.
 Erlang promotes a non-defensive programming style in which processes are
 allowed to crash and be restarted in favour of having the processes recover
 from errors.
 The distributed nature of Erlang means supervisor processes (discussed
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Supervisor-structure"

\end_inset

) can reside on remote systems, thereby increasing the reliability of the
 system as a whole.
\end_layout

A very important feature of Erlang, used in the GGS, is the ability to interface

The dispatcher module is the first module to have contact with a player.

 module, which sets up an accepting socket for each player.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Is this the proper way to day the dispatcher greets connecting players?
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The dispatcher is the module which handles the interfacing to the operating
 system when working with sockets.
 Operating system limits concering the number of open files, or number of
 open sockets are handled here.
 The operating system limits can impose problems on the GGS, this is discussed
 more in detail in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "cha:Problems-of-implementation"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should the dispatcher module fail to function, no new connections to the
 GGS can be made.
 In the event of a crash in the dispatcher module, a supervisor process
 immediately restarts the dispatcher.
 There exists a window of time between the crashing of the dispatcher and
 the restarting of the dispatcher, this window is very short, and only during
 this window is the GGS unable to process new connection requests.
 Due to the modular structure of the GGS, the rest of the system is not
 harmed by the dispatcher process not functioning.
 The process does not contain a state, therefore a simple restart of the
 process is sufficient in restoring the GGS to a pristine state after a
 dispatcher crash

Returning to scenario of the chess club, the dispatcher module is the doorman

 When a player enters the chess club, the player is greeted by the doorman,

 The actual letting in to the club is in the GGS represented by the creation
 of a player process discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The newly created player process is handed, and granted rights to, the

The player module
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The player module is responsible for representing a player in the system.
 Each connected player has its own player process.
 The player process has access to the connection of the player it represents,
 and can communicate with this player.
 In order to communicate with a player, the data to and from the player
 object must pass through a protocol parser module, discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:The-protocol-parser"

\end_inset

.
 Raw communication, witout passing the data through a protocol parser is
 in theory possible, but is not useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the creation of a player process, the coordinator process, discussed
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:The-coordinator-module"

\end_inset

, is notified by the newly connected process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the event of a crash in a player process, several things happen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The player process, which is the only process with a reference to the socket
 leading to the remote client software, passes this reference of the socket
 to the coordinator process temporarily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The player process exits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The coordinator spawns a new player process, with the same socket reference
 as the old player process had.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The player process resumes operation, immediately starting a new protocol
 parser process, and begind receiving and sending network messaged again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The window of time between the crash of the player process and the starting
 of a new player process is, as with the dispatcher, very short.
 Since the connection changes owners for a short period of time, but is
 never dropped, the implications of a crash are only noticed, at worst,
 as choppy gameplay for the client.
 Note however that this crash recovery scheme is not implemented in the
 GGS prototype.

\begin_layout Standard
Moving back to the real world example, the player process represent an actual
 person in the chess club.
 When a person sits down at a table in the chess club, the person does so
 by requesting a seat from some coordinating person, and is then seated
 by the same coordinator.
 Once seated, the player may make moves on the table he or she is seated
 by, this corresponds clearly to how the GGS is structured, as can be seen
 in the following sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The protocol parser module
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The protocol parser is an easily interchangable module in the GGS, handling
 the client-to-server, and server-to-client protocol parsing.
 In the GGS prototype, there is only one protocol supported, namely the
 
\emph on
GGS Protocol
\emph default
.
 The role of the protocol parser is to translate the meaning of packets
 sent using the prototocol in use to internal messages of the GGS system.
 The GGS protocol, discussed below is used as a sample protocol in order
 to explain how protocol parsers can be built for the GGS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The structure of the GGS Protocol
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:The-structure-of"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GGS protocol is modelled after the HTTP protocol.
 The main reason for this is the familiarity many developers already have
 with HTTP due to its presence in internet software.
 Each GGS protocol packet contains a headers section.
 The headers section is followed by a data section.
 In the headers section, parameters concerning the packet is placed.
 In the data section, the actual data payload of the packet is placed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no requirement of any specific order of the parameters in the headers
 section, however the data section must always follow directly after the
 headers section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the example below, line 1 contains a Game-Command parameter.
 This parameter is used to determine which game-specific command the client
 is trying to perform.
 The handling of this parameter is specific to each game, and can be anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Line 2 specifies a game token.
 This is a UUID which is generated for each client upon authentication with
 the GGS.
 The GGS uses this token in case a client is disconnected and the new connection
 created when the client reconnects must be re-paired with the player object
 inside the GGS.
 The UUID is also used as a unique ID within GDL VMs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Line 3 specifies the content type of the payload of this particular packet.
 This parameter allows the GGS to invoke special parsers, should the data
 be encoded or encrypted.
 When encryption is employed, only the payload is encrypted, not the header
 section.
 This is a scheme which does not allow for strong encryption, but is deemed
 feasible for gaming purposes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Line 4 specifies the content length of the payload following immediately
 after the headers section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parser of the GGS protocol implemented in the GGS prototype is designed
 as a finite state machine using the gen_fsm behaviour.
 When a full message has been parsed by the parser, the message is converted
 into the internal structure of the GGS messages, and sent in to the system
 from the protocol paser using message passing.

The coordinator module
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:The-coordinator-module"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coordinator module is responsible for keeping track of all players,
 their seats and tables.
 Players register with the coordinator process when first connecting to
 the server, and the coordinator places each player by their respective
 table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coordinator keeps mappings between each player and table, therefore
 it is used to perform lookups on tables and players to find out which are
 connected.
 The connectivity of players and tables is important when sending messages
 to all participants in a game.
 A lookup in the coordinator process is performed prior to notifying all
 players in a game to ensure the message reaches all players.
 The lookup can be performed either using internal identification codes
 or using the UUID associated with each client and table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coordinator process contains important state, therefore a backup process
 is kept at allt times.
 All good data processed by the coordinator is stored for safekeeping in
 the backup process as well.
 Data which is potentisally harmful is not stored in the backup process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon a crash, the coordinator process recovers the prior good state from
 the backup process and continues where it left off.
 A supervisor process monitors the coordinator process and restarts the
 process when it malfunctions.
 There is a window of time between the crash of the coordinator and the
 restarting of the coordinator, during this time, players can not be seated
 by new tables, and can not disconnect from the server.
 This window of time is very small, and the unavailability of the coordinator
 process should not be noticed by more than a short time lag for the clients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving back to the example of the chess club, the coordinator process can
 be seen as a judge, monitoring all moves of the players.
 At the same time as acting as a judge, the coordinator process is also
 a host in the chess club, seating players by their tables and offering
 services to the players.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The table module
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The table module is mostly a hub used for communication.
 New table processes are created by the coordinator on demand.
 The table module does not contain any business logic, however each process
 contains information concerning which players are seated by that particular
 table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information about which players are seated by each table is used when
 notifying all players by a table of an action.
 Consider a game of chess, each player notifies the table of its actions,
 the table then notifies the rest of the participants of these actions after
 having had the actions processed by the game VM, where an action could
 be moving a playing piece.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each table is associated with a game VM.
 The actions sent to a table are processed by the game VM, this is where
 the game logic is implemented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a crash in a table process, the entire table must be rebuilt and the
 players must be re-associated with the table.
 Data concerning players is kept in the coordinator process, and is restored
 from there.
 Data kept in the actual game is not automatically corrupted by the crash
 in a table, however the table must be re-associated with the game VM is
 was associated with prior to the crash of the table.
 The table process maps well into the setting of the real-worl chess clib
 scenario previously discussed.
 A table works in the same way in a real world setting as in the GGS setting.

\begin_layout Standard
One of the main goals of the project is to achieve high reliability.
 The term

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is defined by the IEEE as a system with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 stated conditions for a specified period of time
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 There are some tools for creating reliable applications built in to Erlang.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Links between processes.
 When a process spawns a new child process, and the child process later
 exits, the parent process is notified of the exit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Transparent distribution over a network of processors.
 When several nodes participate in a network, it does not matter on which
 of these machines a process is run.
 Communication between processes does not depend on the node in which each
 process is run.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Hot code replacements.
 Two versions of the same module can reside in the memory of Erlang at any
 time.
 This means that a simple swap between these versions can take place very
 quickly, and without stopping the machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These three features are some of the basic building blocks for more sophisticate
d reliability systems in Erlang.
 Many times it is not necessary to use these features directly, but rather
 through the design patterns described below.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By linking processes together and notifying parents when children exit,
 supervisors are created.
 A supervisor is a common approach in ensuring that an application functions
 in the way it was intended 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Savor:1997:HSA:851010.856089"

\end_inset

.
 When a process misbehaves, the supervisor takes some action to restore
 the process to a functional state.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several approaches to supervisor design in general (when not just
 considering how they work in Erlang).
 One common approach is to have the supervisor look in to the state of the
 process(es) it supervises, and let the supervisor make decisions based
 on this state.
 The supervisor has a specification of how the process it supervises should
 function, and this is how it makes decisions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Erlang, we have a simple version of supervisors.
 We do not inspect the state of the processes being supervised.
 We do have a specification of how the supervised processes should behave,
 but on a higher level.
 The specification describes things such as how many times in a given time
 interval a child process may crash, which processes need restarting when
 crashes occur, and so forth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the linking of processes in order to monitor exit behaviour is coupled
 with the transparent distribution of Erlang, a very powerful supervision
 system is created.
 For instance, we can restart a failing process on a different, new node,
 with minimal impact on the system as a whole.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the GGS, we have separated the system in to two large supervised parts.
 We try to restart a crashing child separately, if this fails too many

 reasonable upper limit.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 times, we restart the nearest supervisor of this child.
 This ensures separation of the subsystems so that a crash is as isolated
 as possible.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The graphic above shows our two subsystems, the coordinator subsystem and
 the dispatcher subsystem.
 Since these two systems perform very different tasks they have been separated.
 Each subsystem has one worker process, the coordinator or the dispatcher.
 The worker process keeps a state which should not be lost upon a crash.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have chosen to let faulty processes crash very easily when they receive
 bad data, or something unexpected happens.
 The alternative to crashing would have been to try and fix this faulty
 data, or to foresee the unexpected events.
 We chose not to do this because it is so simple to monitor and restart
 processes, and so difficult to try and mend broken states.
 This approach is something widely deployed in the Erlang world, and developers
 are often encouraged to “Let it crash”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To prevent any data loss, the good state of the worker processes is stored
 in their respective backup processes.
 When a worker process (re)starts, it asks the backup process for any previous
 state, if there is any that state is loaded in to the worker and it proceeds
 where it left off.
 If on the other hand no state is available, a special message is delivered
 instead, making the worker create a new state, this is what happens when
 the workers are first created.

\begin_layout Standard
Below is a concrete example of a simple chat server application written
 using the GGS.
 The language chosen for this chat server is JavaScript.
 The GGS processes all incoming data through a protocol parser, which interprets
 the data and parses it into an internal format for the GGS.

, it is passed along to the game VM in a function called 
\emph on
playerCommand.

\emph default
 The 
\emph on
playerCommand
\emph default
 function is responsible for accepting the command into the VM.
 Typically the 
\emph on
playerCommand
\emph default
 function contains conditional constructs which decide the next action to
 take.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:A-concrete-example"

\end_inset

 the 
\emph on
playerCommand
\emph default
 function accepts two different commands.
 The first command is a command which allows chat clients connected to the
 chat server to change nicknames, which are used when chatting.
 In order to change nickname, a client must send 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/nick
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 immediately followed by a nickname.
 When a message arrives to the GGS which has the form corresponding to the
 nickname change, the 
\emph on
playerCommand
\emph default
 function is called with the parameters 
\emph on
player_id, command, 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
args
\emph default
 filled in appropriately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on

 carrying out the actions of each message received.
 
\emph on
changeNick
\emph default
 is a function which is called when the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/nick
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 message is received.
 The

, which is an interface to the database backend contained in the database
 module (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

).
 The database can be used as any key-value store, however the syntax for
 insertions and fetch operations is tighty integrated in the GDL of the
 GGS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Access to the localStorage is provided through the

\begin_layout Section
erlang_js
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be able to run JavaScript on our server we needed to embed a JavaScript
 engine within the server.
 After a thorough investigation erlang_js became our choice.
 Erlang_js provides direct communication with a JavaScript VM (Virtual Machine).
 This was exactly what we wanted, but we also needed the possibility to
 communicate from erlang_js to Erlang.
 This functionality was not yet implemented in erlang_js, due to lack of
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were two possible solutions to the problem.
 We could rewrite some part of erlang_js, or we could switch erlang_js for
 some other JavaScript engine.
 Searching for other engines we found erlv8 and beam.js which provided the
 functionality that we wanted.
 As we tested beam.js it occurred random crashes of the whole Erlang environment.
 These crashes were related to the use of erlv8 in beam.js and we decided
 that the use of erlv8 was not an alternative due to the stability issues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get the functionality needed we decided to implement this in erlang_js.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
UUID 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Erlang identifies processes uniquely throughout the entire Erlang network
 using process IDs (PID).
 When we wish to refer to erlang processes from outside our erlang system,
 for example in a virtual machine for a different language, possibly on
 a different machine, these PID:s are no longer useful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This problem is not new, and a common solution is to use a Universally Unique
 Identifier, a UUID.
 These identifiers are generated both using randomization and using time.
 A reasonably large number of UUID:s can be generated before a collision
 should occur.
 There are standard tools in many UNIX systems to generate UUID:s, we chose
 to use the uuidgen command, which employs an equidistributed combined Tausworth
e generator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Design choices 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When designing concurrent applications, it is useful to picture them as
 real world scenarios, and to model each actor as a real world process.
 A real world process is a process which performs some action in the real
 world, such as a mailbox receiving a letter, a door being opened, a person
 translating a text, a soccer player kicking the ball, just to name a few
 examples.
 Since we focus on games in this project, it is suitable to model our system
 as a place where games take place.
 We imagined a chess club.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The clients pictured as green circles can be thought of as the physical
 chess players.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a player wants to enter the our particular chess club, he must first
 be let in by the doorman, called the 
\emph on
Dispatcher
\emph default
 in the GGS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He then gets a name badge, and thus becomes a 
\emph on
Player
\emph default
 process in the system.
 He is also guided in to the lobby by the 
\emph on
Coordinator
\emph default
, which has the role of the host of the chess club.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When players wish to play against each other, they talk to the 
\emph on
Coordinator
\emph default
 who pairs them up, and places them at a table.
 Once they have sat down at the table, they no longer need the assistance
 of the 
\emph on
Coordinator
\emph default
, all further communication takes place via the table.
 This can be thought of as the actual chess game commencing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the moves made in the game are recorded by the table, such that the
 table can restore the game in case something would happen, such as the
 table tipping over, which would represent the table process crashing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a player wishes to leave a game, or the entire facility, he should
 contact the 
\emph on
Coordinator
\emph default
, who revokes his name badge and the 
\emph on
Dispatcher
\emph default
 will let the player out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the information kept in the tables and the 
\emph on
Coordinator
\emph default
 combined, we can rebuild the entire state of the server at a different
 location.
 This can be thought of the chess club catching fire, and the 
\emph on
Coordinator
\emph default
 rounding up all the tables, running to a new location and building the
 club up in the exact state it was prior to the fire.

Future improvements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The specification of the GGS prototype is huge and like many other software
 projects relying on outside technologies, in time it would require a lot
 of maintanance.
 Therefore there are a lot of areas in which the GGS could be improved such
 as performance, compatibility, ease of setup and usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of TCP being a connection oriented protocol, it isn't suited for
 all types of game data transfers.
 Each transmission will consume more network bandwith than connectionless
 protocols like UDP and cause uneccessary load on the processor.
 Therefore support for UDP would mean that more games could be run simultaneousl
y on the GGS.
 Another advantage of UDP is latency being reduced.
 Without having to setup a connection for each group packets of data being
 sent, they will be sent instantly and therefore arrive earlier.
 Latency is of highest importance in realtime games as it improves realism
 and fairness in gameplay and many game developers requires the freedom
 to take care of safety issues as packet losses themselves.
 This concludes that UDP would be a benefit for GGS, game developers and
 game players alike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Compatibility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GGS relies on modern technologies.
 This includes the virtual machines(vm) that the GGS uses for communication
 between Erlang and the GDL:s.
 These specific vm:s are crucial for game developers to be able to write
 games in other languages than Erlang.
 Therefore it would be best for the GGS to have as many of these vm:s implemente
d as possible.
 The vm:s taken into consideration so far have been unstable or incomplete
 and it is possible to search for more vm:s, testing them and intergrate
 them into the GGS prototype.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Setup
