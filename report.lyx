Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Online gaming, and computer gaming in general has become an important part
 in many peoples day-to day lives.
 A few years ago, computer games were not at all as popular as they are
 today.
 With the advances in computer graphics and computer hardware today's games
 are much more sophisticated then they were in the days of 
\emph on
NetHack
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Zork, 
\emph default
or 
\emph on

\begin_layout Standard
The early computer games featured simple, or no graphics at all

 The games often took place in a textual world, leaving the task of picturing
 the world up to the player.
 Multiplayer games were not as common as they are today, whereas most games
 today are expected to have a multiplayer mode, most early games did not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since these early games, the gaming industry have become much more influential
 in many ways.
 Many advanced in computer hardware are thought to come from pressure from
 the computer game industry.
 More powerful games require more powerful, and more easily available hardware

 Due to the high entertainment value of modern computer games, gaming has

 The gaming industry is today, in some places even larger than the motion
 picture industry.

Due to the increasing importance of computer gaming, more focus should be
 spent on improving the quality of the gaming service.
 As more and more computer games are gaining multiplayer capabilities, the
 demands for multiplayer networking software rises.
 This thesis is about techniques for improving the quality of this networking
 software.

\backslash
nomenclature{

\end_inset

, is a computer program designed to 
\emph on
host
\emph default
 network games on one or more server computers.
 Hosting, in a network software setting, means allowing client software
 connect to the server software, for the purpose of utilizing services provided
 by the server.
 The GGS software provides games as a service, and the clients connecting
 to the GGS can play these games on the GGS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of game servers is not new, network games have been played for
 decades.
 Early, popular examples of network games include the 
\emph on
Quake

 series, or the 
\emph on
Doom

\emph default
 games.
 Newer examples of network games include 
\emph on
World of Warcraft
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
Counter-Strike
\emph default
.
 The difference between the GGS and the servers for these games is that
 the servers for Doom, Quake, and the others listed, were designed with
 these specific games in mind.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What GGS does is to provide a 
\emph on
generic
\emph default
 framework for developing network games.
 The framework is generic in the sense that it is not bound to a specific
 game.
 There are many different types of games, some are inherently more time
 sensitive than others, strategy games are examples of games which are not
 very sensitive to time delays, first-person shooters however, can be very
 sensitive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The generic nature of the GGS allows the creation of many different types
 of games, the motivation behind this is to remove the necessity of writing
 new game servers when developing new games.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GGS is in addition to being generic, also 
\emph on
reliable
\emph default
 in the sense that the gaming service provided is consistent and available.
 A consistent and available server is a server that handles hardware failures
 and software failures gracefully.
 In the event of a component breaking within the GGS, the error is handled
 by fault recovery processes, thereby creating a more reliable system.

 Users will notice this in low uptime and many crashes.
 This is a problem that has existed and been resolved in other industries.
 In the telecom industry solutions to similar problems have been found.

 The level of instability and bad fault tolerance seen in the game server
 industry would not have been accepted in the telecoms industry.
 This level of instability should not be accepted in the game server industry
 either.
 An unavailable phone system could potentially have life threatening consequence
s, leaving the public unable to contact emergency services.
 The same can not be said about an unavailable game server.
 The statement that game servers are less important than phone systems is
 not a reason not to draw wisdom from what the telecoms have already learned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving back to the gaming industry.
 The main reason to develop reliable servers are monetary, it is important
 for game companies to expand its customer base.
 Reliable game servers are one improvement that will create a good image
 of a company.
 In general the downtime of game servers is much higher than the downtime
 of telecom system 
\begin_inset Note Note

\end_inset

.
 The structure of the system is similar in many ways and it should be possible
 to reuse solutions from the telecom system to improve game servers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the current state game servers are developed on a per-game basis, in
 many cases this seems like a bad solution.
 Developers of network game need to understand network programming.
 A way to change this is a generic game server which give the game developers
 a server which they implement their game towards.
 This approach would not only make it easier to develop network games, it
 would also allow games in different programming languages to be implemented
 using the same server.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some factors key to the development of GGS have been isolated.
 Many of these come from the telecom sector.
 The factors are 
\emph on
scalability, fault tolerance 
\emph default
and being 
\emph on
generic
\emph default
.
 These terms are defined below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scalability (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Scalability"

\end_inset

) in computer science is a large topic and is commonly divided into sub-fields,
 two of which are 
\emph on
structural scalability
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
load scalability
\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bondi:2000:CSI:350391.350432"

\end_inset

.
 These two issues are addressed in this thesis.
 Structural scalability means expanding an architecture, e.g.
 adding nodes to a system without requiring modification of the system.
 Load scalability means using the available resources in a way which allows
 handling increasing load, e.g more users, gracefully.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fault tolerance (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Fault-Tolerance"

\end_inset

) is used to raise the level of 
\emph on
dependability
\emph default
 in a system, so that the dependability is high even in presence of errors.
 Dependability is defined as the statistical probability of the system functioni
ng as intended at a given point in time.
 Fault tolerance is defined as the property of a system to always follow
 a specification, even in the presence of errors.
 The specification could take the form of error handling procedures which
 activate when an error occurs.
 This means that a fault tolerant, dependable system, will have a very high
 probability of functioning at a given point in time, and is exactly what
 is desired.

A generic (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Generic"

\end_inset

) game server has to be able to run different client-server network games
 regardless of the platform the clients are running on.
 It runs network games of different type.
 A very rough separation of games is real time games and turn based games.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The server behaves in a way similar to an application server, but is designed
 to help running games.
 An application server provides processing ability and time, therefore it
 is different from a file- or print-server, which only serves resources
 to the clients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common type of application servers are web servers, where you run
 a web application within the server.
 The application server provides an environment and interfaces to the outer
 world, in which applications run.
 Hooks and helpers are provided to use the resources of the server.
 Some examples for web application servers are the 
\emph on
Glassfish
\emph default
 server which allows running applications written in Java or the 
\emph on
Google App Engine
\emph default
 where you can run applications written in Python or some language which
 runs in the 
\emph on
Java Virtual Machine
\emph default
.
 An example of an application server not powering web applications, but
 instead regular business logic, is Oracle’s 
\emph on
TUXEDO
\emph default
 application server, which can be used to run applications written in COBOL,
 C++ and other languages.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One purpose of this thesis is to investigate how we can make a game server
 as generic as possible.
 Some important helpers are discussed, such as abstraction of the network
 layer, data store and game specific features.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an aid in discussing the theoretical parts of the GGS a prototype has
 been developed.
 The prototype does not feature all of the characteristics described in
 this thesis.
 A selection has been made among the features, and the most important ones
 have been implemented either full or in part in the prototype.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The choice of implementation language for the prototype of the GGS was made
 with inspiration from the telecom industry.
 The Erlang language was developed by the telecom company Ericsson to develop
 highly available and dependable telecom switches.
 One of the most reliable systems ever developed by Ericsson, the AXD301
 was developed using Erlang.
 The AXD301 is also possibly has the largest code base even written in a
 functional language

The purpose of the GGS project.
 What is the purpose of creating a fault tolerant server, why is it generic,
 and what good does it do to have a scalable system? In the background,
 we should give the motivations behind creating this software, but here
 we should outline why the software is needed.
 This section should be shortened, and the bulk of the text should be moved
 to theory or background.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of creating a generic and fault tolerant game server is to provide
 a good framework for the development of many different types of games.
 Allowing the system to scale up and down is a powerful way to maximize
 the usage of physical resources.
 By scaling up to new machines when load increases, and scaling down from
 machines when load decreases costs and energy consumption can be optimized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fault tolerance is important for the GGS to create a reliable service.
 The purpose of a reliable game server is to provide a consistent service
 to people using the server.
 Going back to the telecom example, the purpose of creating a reliable telecom
 system is to allow calls, possibly emergency calls, at any time.
 Should the telecom network be unavailable at any time, emergency services
 may become unavailable, furthermore the consumer image of the telecom system
 degrades.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Returning to the game industry, emergency services will not be contacted
 using a game server, however an unavailable server will degrade the consumer
 image of the system.
 Consider an online casino company.
 The online casino company's servers must be available at all times to allow
 customers to play.
 If the servers are unavailable, customers can not play, and the company
 loses money.
 In this scenario, an unavailable server can be compared to a closed real-world
 casino.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Challenges in developing the prototype
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word 
\emph on
generic
\emph default
 in the name of the GGS implies that the system is able to run a very broad
 range of different code, for instance code wrote in different programming
 languages, besides a broad range of different game types.
 To support this, a virtual machine (VM) for each 
\emph on
game development language
\emph default
 (hereafter GDL for brevity) is used.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No hard limit has been set on which languages can be used for game development
 on the GGS, but there are several factors which decide the feasibility
 of a language:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How well it integrates with Erlang, which is used in the core the GGS system
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How easy it is to send messages to the virtual machine of the GDL from the
 GGS 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How easy it is to send messages from the GDL VM to the GGS
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Add more like threads, events, etc.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Internally, the GDL VM needs to interface with the GGS to make use of the
 helpers and tools that the GGS provides.
 Thus an internal API has to be designed for use in interacting with the
 GGS.
 This API is ideally completely independent of the GDL, and reusable for
 any GDL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The communication with gaming clients has to take place over a protocol.
 Ideally a standard protocol should be used, in order to shorten the learning
 curve for developers, and also make the system as a whole less obscure.
 A large challenge during this project is to decide whether an existing
 protocol can be used, and if not, how a new protocol can be designed which
 performs technically as desired, while still being familiar enough to existing
 developers.

A great deal of work is devoted to make the GGS

.
 This includes ensuring that the system scales well, and to make sure it
 is fault tolerant.
 In order to facilitate scalability, we need a storage platform which is
 accessible and consistent among all of the GGS, this is also investigated.

\begin_layout Section
Limitations of the prototype
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implementation of the GGS protocol, together with storage possibilities,
 server capacity, and game language support imposes some limitations on
 the project.
 To get a functional prototype some limits must be set on the types games
 that can be played on the prototype.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The UDP protocol is not supported for communication between client and server.
 The TCP protocol was chosen in favor of UDP, due to the fact that the implement
ation process using TCP was faster than if UDP would have been used.
 UDP is generally considered to be faster than TCP for the transfer of game
 (and other) related data, this is discussed in more depth in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Choice-of-network"

\end_inset

.
 In short, the decision of using TCP means that games that requires a high
 speed protocol will not be supported by the GGS prototype.
 Another limitation necessary to set on the system is the possibility to
 have huge game worlds due to the implementation of the scaling mechanism
 in the prototype.

.
 Both game types have varying difficulties and needs when it comes to implementi

 to accomplish his goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the limited capability of threading in many GDL VMs, the GGS prototype
 will not support MMORPGs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implementation of the GGS described in this thesis is only a small prototype
 and tests will be performed on simple games like pong or chess, thus there
 are no need to implement more advanced features in the system.
 Note that these limitations only apply for the prototype of the project,
 and that further developments to the GGS could be to implement these features.

Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A prototype was developed early on in the project to carry out experiments.
 Using this prototype, the system was divided into modules.
 A demand specification was created, using this specification, the modules
 were easily identifiable.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first prototype of the GGS consisted of simple modules, however, due
 to the separation of concerns among the modules, they were easily independently
 modified and improved.
 Once the basic structure of the GGS had been established, the first prototype
 was removed, remaining was the structure of the modules and the internal
 flow of the application.
 This could be seen as an iterative workflow, with the first prototype being
 the first iteration.
 The second iteration later became the final result of the GGS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The layout of the GGS is both layered and modular.
 The first layer handles the most primitive data and produces a higher level
 representation of the data, passing it along to different modules of the
 GGS.
 The modular structure of the GGS plays an important role in making the
 system fault tolerant.
 The approach to fault tolerance is by replication, and restarting the faulting
 modules with the last known good data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An informal specification and list of requirements of the system was outlined
 early on in the project.
 Usability goals for developers were set.
 During the project several demo applications were constructed, by constructing
 these applications, the usability goals were enforced.

Design of the GGS system
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GGS is modeled after a real world system performing much of the same
 duties as GGS.
 This is common practice 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "armstrong2011"

\end_inset

 in the computer software world, to understand complex problems more easily.
 While there may not always be a real world example of a system performing
 the exact duties of the system being modeled in the computer, it is often
 easier to create and analyze requirements for real world systems and processes
 than systems existing solely in a computer.
 The requirements and limitations imposed on the real-world system can,
 using the proper tools, be transferred in to the software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The real world system chosen for the GGS is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Chess club
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - a building where chess players can meet and play chess.
 Since a real-world scenario is readily available, and to such a large extent
 resembles the computer software required for the GGS, the next step in
 developing the GGS system is to duplicate this real world scenario in a
 software setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some requirements, limitations and additions were made to the chess club
 system, so that the system would more easily and efficiently be replicated
 in a software setting.
\end_layout

 play chess against each other, the other example is the GGS, and how it

 In the GGS setting, the building would represent one instance of GGS.
 Several buildings linked together would represent a cluster of GGS instances.
 In order for a player (the P symbol in the graphic) to enter the theoretical
 chess club, the player must pass by the entrance.
 By having each player pass by the entrance, a tally

\end_inset

 can be kept, ensuring that there are not too many players within the building.
 In the GGS setting, too many players entering would mean too many connections
 have been accepted by the GGS system, and that the structure of the system
 thus must be modified, adding additional servers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a player has been allowed in to the chess club the player is greeted
 by the host of the chess club, in the GGS setting represented by the 
\emph on
Coordinator
\emph default
, and is seated by a table.
 The coordinator keeps track of all the players in the building, and all
 moved made by the players.
 The information available to the coordinator means that cheating can be
 monitored and book keeping can be performed by this entity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moves by players are made using the tables present in the chess club.
 Every game is isolated to a table, just as expected.
 This means that communication during a game only has to pass by the players
 of that particular game, and the coordinator, making sure that no cheating
 takes place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This isolation of the games play an important part in many properties of
 the GGS, the isolation means that games can for example be transferred
 among different chess clubs, furthermore, if cheating takes place, corruption
 can only occur in the particular table where it was found, and can not
 spread.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving chess players from one location to another is one alteration made
 to the real world chess club system to make the system more appropriate
 for a software setting.
 Allowing games to be transferred is not a property usually desired in a
 real world chess club, where transferring players would mean moving the
 players from one building to another.
 In the software setting, moving players means moving the game processes
 from one system to another, perhaps to balance the system load.
 This transfer of players can occur transparently, without notifying the
 players.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplified life cycle of a game in GGS can be viewed using algorithm

 the algorithm behaves as efficient as possible, and are not the main focus

Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many ways in which performance could be measured.
 For the clients, time and response times are useful measurements in time
 critical settings.
 In non-time critical settings, the reliability of message delivery may
 be an even more important factor than speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a first person shooter game, the speed of delivery of messages is essential.
 Failure to deliver messages in time results in choppy gameplay for the
 players.
 In strategy games, the reliability of delivery may be more important than
 the speed, since the game is not perceived as choppy even if the messages
 are delayed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
There are two main ways in which computer communication over the Internet
 usually takes place; TCP, UDP are known network layer protocols and HTTP
 is the most prominent application layer protocol.
 The transport layer protocols, are commonly used to transport application
 layer protocols, such as HTTP.
 TCP and UDP can not be used on their own, without an application layer
 protocol on top.
 Application layer protocols such as HTTP on the other hand needs a transport
 layer protocol in order to work.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
HTTP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since HTTP is so widely used on the Internet today in web servers, it is
 available on most Internet connected devices.
 This means that if HTTP is used in the GGS, firewalls will not pose problems,
 which is a great benefit.
 However, due to the intended usage of HTTP in web servers, the protocol
 was designed to be stateless and client-initiated.
 In order to maintain a state during a game session using HTTP, some sort
 of token would have to be passed between client and server at all times,
 much like how a web server works.
 These facts combined makes HTTP unsuitable for our purposes, since the
 GGS requires a state to be maintained throughout a session, and also needs
 to push data from the server to clients without the clients requesting
 data.
 It should also be mentioned that HTTP uses the TCP protocol for transport,
 and what is said about TCP also applies to HTTP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
UDP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many online games use UDP as the carrier for their application layer protocol.
 UDP moves data across a network very quickly, however it does not ensure
 that the data transferred arrives in consistent manner.
 Data sent via UDP may be repeated, lost or out of order.
 To ensure the data transferred is in good shape, some sort of error checking
 mechanisms must be implemented.
 UDP is a good choice for applications where it is more important that data
 arrives in a timely manner than that all data arrives undamaged, it is
 thus very suitable for media streaming, for example.
 In the GGS reliability of transfer was chosen before the speed of the transfer,
 ruling out UDP as the transport later protocol.
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Perhaps we should only say that we chose TCP just for our GGS prototype
 and why.
 If we leave it like that it seems that we think it is not suitable.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
TCP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For reliable transfers, TCP is often used on the Internet.
 Built in to the protocol are the error checking and correction mechanisms
 missing in UDP.
 This ensures the consistency of data, but also makes the transfer slower
 than if UDP had been used.
 In the GGS, data consistency is more important than transfer speeds, and
 thus TCP is a better alternative than UDP.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Same here it is simply not true for a generic server to chose one or the
 other.

 etc, but also in the way the game is implemented.
 Such as different programming languages.
 The GGS should be OS independent and run on Windows, OSX and Linux.
 The GGS can be run as a listen server on the players computer and host
 games locally.
 It could also be a dedicated server running on independent hardware.

Fault Tolerance
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sec:Fault-Tolerance"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fault tolerance is an important factor in all servers, a server that is
 fault tolerant should be able to follow a given specification when parts
 of the system failures.
 This means that fault tolerance is different in each system depending on
 what specification they have.
 A system could be fault tolerant in different aspects, one is where the
 system is guaranteed to be available but not safe and it could also be
 reversed, that the system is safe but not guaranteed to be available.
 Depending on the system one property may be more important(some example
 here).
 A system could also have non existent fault tolerance or it could be both
 safe and guaranteed to be available.
 It should be noted that it is not possible to achieve complete fault tolerance,
 a system will always have a certain risk of failure.
 With this in mind the goal is to make the GGS prototype as fault tolerant
 as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to make the GGS prototype fault tolerant the programming language
 Erlang has been used.
 Erlang will not guarantee a fault tolerant system but it has features that
 support and encourage the development of fault tolerant systems.
 In the GGS it is important that the system overall is fault tolerant.
 Crashes of the whole system should be avoided as this would make the system
 unusable for a time.
 By using supervisor structures it is possible to crash and restart small
 parts of the system, this is convenient as fault can be handled within
 small modules thus never forcing a crash of the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The need for fault tolerance in game servers is not as obvious as it may
 be for other type of servers.
 In general all servers strive to be fault tolerant as fault tolerance means
 more uptime and a safer system.
 This applies to game servers as well, in brief good fault tolerance is
 a way of satisfying customers.
 In general, game servers differ from many other fault tolerant systems
 in that high-availability is more important than the safety of the system.
 For example a simple calculation error will not be critical for a game
 server but it may be in a life-critical system and then it is better that
 the system crashes than works with the faulty data.
 There are cases where safety may be critical in game servers, one example
 is in games where in-game money exist.

 Erlang has been used which offers several features to increase the availability.
 Some of them are

Scalability
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sec:Scalability"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each instance of the GGS contains several tables.
 Each table is an isolated instance of a game, for example a chess game
 or a poker game.
 The way that the GGS scales is to distribute these tables on different
 servers.
 In many games it is not necessary for a player to move among tables during
 games.
 This is for example not a common occurrence in chess, where it would be
 represented as a player standing up from her current table and sitting
 down at a new table, all within the same game session.
 Therefore, the main focus of the GGS is not to move players among tables,
 but to keep a player in a table, and to start new tables instead.
 When a server has reached a certain number of players the performance will
 start to decrease.
 To avoid this the GGS will start new tables on another server, using this
 technique the players will be close to evenly distributed among the servers.
 It is important to investigate and find out how many players that are optimal
 for each server.
 This approach makes it possible to use all resources with moderate load,
 instead of having some resources with heavy load and some with almost no
 load.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in the purpose section there are two different types of scalability
, structural scalability and load scalability.
 To make the GGS scalable both types of scalability are needed.
 Structural scalability means in our case that it should be possible to
 add more servers to an existing cluster of servers.
 By adding more servers the limits of how many users a system can have is
 increased.
 Load scalability in contrast to structural scalability is not about how
 to increase the actual limits of the system.
 Instead it means how good the system handles increased load.
 The GGS should be able to scale well in both categories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Load balancing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The need for load balancing varies among different kind of systems.
 Small systems that only use one or a couple of servers can cope with a
 simple implementation of it, while in large systems it is critical to have
 extensive and well working load balancing.
 The need also depends on what kind of server structure that the system
 works on.
 A static structure where the number of servers are predefined or a dynamic
 structure where the number varies.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Load balancing and scaling is difficult in different scenarios.
 When running in a separate server park, there are a set number of servers
 available, this means that an even distribution on all servers is preferable.
 When running the GGS in a cloud, such as Amazon EC2, it is possible to
 add an almost infinite number of servers as execution goes on.
 In this cloud setting, it may be more important to evenly distribute load
 on newly added servers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two methods of balancing load (increasing structure):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fill up the capacity of one server completely, and then move over to the
 next server 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Evenly distribute all clients to all servers from the beginning, when load
 becomes too high on all of them, then comes a new problem: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
How do we distribute load on these new servers?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Load balancing is a key component to achieve scalability in network systems.
 The GGS is a good example of a system that needs to be scalable, to attain
 this load balancing is necessary.
 Optimization of the load balancing for a system is an important task to
 provide a stable and fast load balancer.
 There are certain persistence problems that can occur with load balancing,
 if a player moves from a server to another data loss may occur.
 This is an important aspect to consider when the load balancer is designed
 and implemented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Load balancing can often be implemented using dedicated software, this means
 that in many applications load balancing may not be implemented because
 it already exist functional solutions.
 This depends on what specific needs the system have and a minor goal of
 the project is to analyze whether the GGS project can use existing load
 balancing tools or if it is necessary to implement load balancing in the
 project.

Because P2P game architectures are a constant goal for cheaters and because
 “Cheating is a major concern in network games as it degrades the experience
 of the majority of players who are honest” and preventing cheating in P2P

 - Server architectures which have a natural problem to scale.
 In this paper we want to show some strategies to achieve scalability.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inside the GGS, everything has a unique identifier.
 There are identifiers for players, tables and other resources.
 When players communicate amongst each other, or communicate with tables,
 they need to be able to uniquely identify all of these resources.
 Within one machine, this is mostly not a problem.
 A simple system with a counter can be imagined, where each request for
 a new ID increments the previous identifier and returns the new identifier
 based off the old one, see algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:A-simple-generator"

\end_inset

.
 This solution poses problems when dealing with concurrent and distributed
 systems.
 In concurrent systems, the simple solution in algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:A-simple-generator"

\end_inset

 may yield non-unique identifiers due to the lack of mutual exclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The obvious solution to this problem is to ensure mutual exclusion by using
 some sort of lock, which may work well in many concurrent systems.
 In a distributed system, this lock, along with the state, would have to
 be distributed.
 If the lock is not distributed, no guarantee can be made that two nodes
 in the distributed system do not generate the same number.
 A different approach is to give each node the ability to generate Universally
 Unique Identifiers (UUID), where the state of one machine does not interfere
 with the state of another.

Testing

There are several ways in which the GGS can be tested.
 The most important aspect has been deemed to be the experience players
 have when using the GGS.
 In order to test the user experience of the GGS, a realistic usage scenario
 has to be set up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GGS is intended to be used for powering games which have many concurrent
 players.
 The players need not participate in the same instance of the game, games
 such as chess are prime candidates for the GGS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When developing the GGS, two main categories of games exhibiting different
 performance demands were identified; real-time games and turn-based games.
 The real-time games were deemed more demanding than the turn based games.
 Tests were carried out using a real time game, since this is the more demanding
 type of games.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The real time game chosen for testing the GGS is 
\emph on
Pong
\emph default
, a game in which two players play a game involving a all and two paddles.
 The goal for each player is to shoot beside the other players paddle while
 not allowing the ball to pass by her own paddle.
 The game requires real time updates and is quite demanding when played
 in several instances concurrently.

 enough processes could be created to successfully test the server.

The cost of swapping operating system processes becomes a problem when many
 processes are involved.
 If the GGS system had been developed using regular operating system processes,
 it would have had to be designed in a way to minimize the number of processes.
 Using Erlang, which is capable of running very many processes, several
 times more than an operating system can, the mapping between the real world
 system (described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Design-of-the"

\end_inset

) becomes clearer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Erlang allows the GGS to create several process for each player connecting,
 these processes can handle a multitude of different tasks, parsing data
 for example.
 Since each task is handled by a different process, the tasks are clearly
 separated and the failure of one is easily recovered without affecting
 the others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to creating (or

spawning
\emph default
) processes specifically to handle new players connecting, the GGS has more
 permanent processes running at all times.
 The constantly running processes in the GGS system are called

modules

.
 An example of a module in the GGS is the 
\emph on
dispatcher module
\emph default
, which handles the initial connection made by a client, passing the connection
 along further in to the system.

 The reason for using message passing, according to Armstrong, was that

 efficient internal communication within the Erlang machine was considered
 a later optimization.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strong isolation of Erlang processes make them ideal for multi-core
 and distributed systems.
 Distribution of software is included as a fundamental part in the Erlang
 language.
 The 'physical' location of a process, e.g.
 which computer the process runs on, is not important when communicating
 with the process.
 Processes can communicate regardless of whether they run on the same system
 of not, transparently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distributed nature of Erlang is something the GGS makes use of when
 scaling across several computers in order to achieve higher performance.
 The distribution is also important in creating redundancy.
 Erlang promotes a non-defensive programming style in which processes are
 allowed to crash and be restarted in favor of having the processes recover
 from errors.
 The distributed nature of Erlang means supervisor processes (discussed
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Supervisor-structure"

\end_inset

) can reside on remote systems, thereby increasing the reliability of the
 system as a whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A very important feature of Erlang, used in the GGS, is the ability to interface
 with external hardware and software.
 Erlang allows communication with external resources through 
\emph on
ports
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
NIF
\emph default
s (Native implemented functions)
\emph on
.

\emph default
 Through ports communication can take place much in the same way communication
 is performed over sockets.
 NIFs are called like any other functions without any difference to the
 caller but are implemented in C.

\begin_layout Standard
Development of the GGS would have been hard if not impossible had it not
 been for the 
\emph on
OTP
\emph default
 supplied with the standard Erlang distribution.
 The OTP (Open Telecom Platform) is a set of standard libraries and design
 patterns, called 
\emph on
behaviors
\emph default
, which are used when developing Erlang systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GGS makes heavy use of the behaviors supplied in the OTP.
 The behaviors impose a programming style suitable for distributed and concurren
t applications, perfectly suitable for the GGS.
 In particular, the GGS uses the following behaviors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
supervisor
\emph default
 behavior, which is used when creating a supervisor.
 Supervisors are used when monitoring processes in the Erlang system.
 When a process exits wrongfully, the supervisor monitoring the process
 in question decides which action to take.
 In the GGS, the most common action is simply to restart the faulting process.
 A more thorough discussion on supervisors can be found in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Supervisor-structure"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
gen_tcp 
\emph default
behavior, which is used to work with TCP sockets for network communication.
 Using the gen_tcp behavior, network messages are converted to internal
 Erlang messages and passed to a protocol parser, where the messages are
 processed further.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
gen_server
\emph default
 behavior, which is used when constructing OTP servers in Erlang.
 Using this behavior, a state can easily be kept in a server process, greatly
 increasing the usefulness of the server process.
 There are many gen_servers in the GGS, it is the most widely used behavior
 in the project.
 In addition to introducing a state to the server, the gen_server behavior
 also imposes patterns for synchronous and asynchronous communication between
 other gen_servers and other OTP behaviors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
gen_fsm
\emph default
 behavior is used in the protocol parser module in the GGS.
 Using the gen_fsm behavior, finite state machines are easily developed.
 Protocol parsers are an ideal example of where to use finite state machines,
 which are widely used for parsing strings of text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to supplying behaviors, the OTP also has a style for packaging
 and running Erlang applications.
 By packaging the GGS as an 
\emph on
application 
\emph default
the GGS can be started in a way uniform to most erlang software, providing
 familiarity for other Erlang users, and eases the incorporation of the
 GGS in other applications.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A game launched on the GGS is run within a virtual machine.
 For each programming language supported, there is a virtual machine that
 interprets the game.
 Furthermore an interface for communication between the GGS, the game and
 the players playing the game must be present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason for the GGS requiring a communication channel between the game
 VM and Erlang is in part because the GGS makes heavy use of callbacks.
 Callbacks written in Erlang are registered to the VM for the interface
 to work.
 It is only with the help of the interface that the game developer can access
 the game state and send messages between players.
 The interface provides access to three objects called 
\emph on
world
\emph default
, 
\emph on
player
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
localstorage
\emph default
.
 The game state is safely stored in a database and retrieved for manipulation
 by a call for the world object.
 Interaction with the players is done the same way using the player object
 instead.
 The localstorage is a convenient way to store global data and other data
 separated from the game state.
 In section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Exposing Erlang functionality to the GDL VM 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Exposing-Erlang-functionality"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section contains a concrete example of how the localstorage and world
 objects are exposed to a GDL VM.
 The example comes from the GGS prototype, which uses JavaScript powered
 by Google V8 as its GDL VM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The code given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:exposing-erlang"

\end_inset

 is specific to V8 and JavaScript, however implementations for different
 GDLs, or different JavaScript VMs should be similar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In JavaScript is is common to use a top level object, called a global object,
 to establish a global scope.
 This allows declaration of global variables and functions.
 To gain access to the global object in the GGS, the 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
tt erlv8
\backslash
_vm:global(..)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 function on line 2 of the example is used.
 Using the global object, declarations of the world and GGS object can be
 placed in the global scope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
tt Global:set
\backslash
_value(..)}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is a call to the global object, declaring new objects in the global scope.
 On line 4 the GGS object is declared.
 By accessing 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
tt GGS.localStorage }
\end_layout

\end_inset

 from within the GDL, access to the localstorage is provided, thus the localstor
age must be connected to the GGS object, this can be seen in line 5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the GGS and localstorage objects are dummy objects, which provide no
 functionality, these two objects are simply placed in the GDL for the purpose
 clearing up the code.
 In order to perform an action using the GGS and localstorage objects, the
 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
tt getItem} and {
\backslash
tt setItem}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 functions must be used.
 These items are directly connected to the database module of the GGS, which
 is discussed in more detail in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:The-database-module"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly the functions 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\backslash
tt sendCommand, sendCommandToAll} and {
\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

 The dispatcher is the module which handles the interfacing to the operating

 Operating system limits concerning the number of open files, or number
 of open sockets are handled here.
 The operating system limits can impose problems on the GGS, this is discussed
 more in detail in chapter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Should the dispatcher module fail to function, no new connections to the
 GGS can be made.
 In the event of a crash in the dispatcher module, a supervisor process
 immediately restarts the dispatcher.
 There exists a window of time between the crashing of the dispatcher and
 the restarting of the dispatcher, this window is very short, and only during
 this window is the GGS unable to process new connection requests.
 Due to the modular structure of the GGS, the rest of the system is not
 harmed by the dispatcher process not functioning.
 The process does not contain a state, therefore a simple restart of the
 process is sufficient in restoring the GGS to a pristine state after a
 dispatcher crash

Returning to scenario of the chess club, the dispatcher module is the doorman

 When a player enters the chess club, the player is greeted by the doorman,

 The actual letting in to the club is in the GGS represented by the creation
 of a player process discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
The player module is responsible for representing a player in the system.
 Each connected player has its own player process.
 The player process has access to the connection of the player it represents,
 and can communicate with this player.
 In order to communicate with a player, the data to and from the player
 object must pass through a protocol parser module, discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Raw communication, without passing the data through a protocol parser is

In the creation of a player process, the coordinator process, discussed

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the event of a crash in a player process, several things happen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The player process, which is the only process with a reference to the socket
 leading to the remote client software, passes this reference of the socket
 to the coordinator process temporarily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The player process exits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The coordinator spawns a new player process, with the same socket reference
 as the old player process had.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The player process resumes operation, immediately starting a new protocol
 parser process, and begins to receive and send network messages again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The window of time between the crash of the player process and the starting
 of a new player process is, as with the dispatcher, very short.
 Since the connection changes owners for a short period of time, but is
 never dropped, the implications of a crash are only noticed, at worst,
 as choppy gameplay for the client.
 Note however that this crash recovery scheme is not implemented in the
 GGS prototype.

 by requesting a seat from some coordinating person, and is then seated
 by the same coordinator.
 Once seated, the player may make moves on the table he or she is seated
 by, this corresponds clearly to how the GGS is structured, as can be seen
 in the following sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The protocol parser module
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:The-protocol-parser"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The protocol parser is an easily interchangeable module in the GGS, handling
 the client-to-server, and server-to-client protocol parsing.
 In the GGS prototype, there is only one protocol supported, namely the
 
\emph on
GGS Protocol
\emph default
.
 The role of the protocol parser is to translate the meaning of packets
 sent using the protocol in use to internal messages of the GGS system.
 The GGS protocol, discussed below is used as a sample protocol in order
 to explain how protocol parsers can be built for the GGS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The structure of the GGS Protocol
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:The-structure-of"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GGS protocol is modeled after the HTTP protocol.
 The main reason for this is the familiarity many developers already have
 with HTTP due to its presence in internet software.
 Each GGS protocol packet contains a headers section.
 The headers section is followed by a data section.
 In the headers section, parameters concerning the packet is placed.
 In the data section, the actual data payload of the packet is placed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no requirement of any specific order of the parameters in the headers
 section, however the data section must always follow directly after the
 headers section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the example below, line 1 contains a Game-Command parameter.
 This parameter is used to determine which game-specific command the client
 is trying to perform.
 The handling of this parameter is specific to each game, and can be anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Line 2 specifies a game token.
 This is a UUID which is generated for each client upon authentication with
 the GGS.
 The GGS uses this token in case a client is disconnected and the new connection
 created when the client reconnects must be re-paired with the player object
 inside the GGS.
 The UUID is also used as a unique ID within GDL VMs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Line 3 specifies the content type of the payload of this particular packet.
 This parameter allows the GGS to invoke special parsers, should the data
 be encoded or encrypted.
 When encryption is employed, only the payload is encrypted, not the header
 section.
 This is a scheme which does not allow for strong encryption, but is deemed
 feasible for gaming purposes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Line 4 specifies the content length of the payload following immediately
 after the headers section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parser of the GGS protocol implemented in the GGS prototype is designed
 as a finite state machine using the gen_fsm behavior.
 When a full message has been parsed by the parser, the message is converted
 into the internal structure of the GGS messages, and sent in to the system
 from the protocol parser using message passing.

The coordinator module
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:The-coordinator-module"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coordinator module is responsible for keeping track of all players,
 their seats and tables.
 Players register with the coordinator process when first connecting to
 the server, and the coordinator places each player by their respective
 table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coordinator keeps mappings between each player and table, therefore
 it is used to perform lookups on tables and players to find out which are
 connected.
 The connectivity of players and tables is important when sending messages
 to all participants in a game.
 A lookup in the coordinator process is performed prior to notifying all
 players in a game to ensure the message reaches all players.
 The lookup can be performed either using internal identification codes
 or using the UUID associated with each client and table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coordinator process contains important state, therefore a backup process
 is kept at all times.
 All good data processed by the coordinator is stored for safekeeping in
 the backup process as well.
 Data which is potentially harmful is not stored in the backup process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Upon a crash, the coordinator process recovers the prior good state from
 the backup process and continues where it left off.
 A supervisor process monitors the coordinator process and restarts the
 process when it malfunctions.
 There is a window of time between the crash of the coordinator and the
 restarting of the coordinator, during this time, players can not be seated
 by new tables, and can not disconnect from the server.
 This window of time is very small, and the unavailability of the coordinator
 process should not be noticed by more than a short time lag for the clients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving back to the example of the chess club, the coordinator process can
 be seen as a judge, monitoring all moves of the players.
 At the same time as acting as a judge, the coordinator process is also
 a host in the chess club, seating players by their tables and offering
 services to the players.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The table module
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The table module is mostly a hub used for communication.
 New table processes are created by the coordinator on demand.
 The table module does not contain any business logic, however each process
 contains information concerning which players are seated by that particular
 table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information about which players are seated by each table is used when
 notifying all players by a table of an action.
 Consider a game of chess, each player notifies the table of its actions,
 the table then notifies the rest of the participants of these actions after
 having had the actions processed by the game VM, where an action could
 be moving a playing piece.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each table is associated with a game VM.
 The actions sent to a table are processed by the game VM, this is where
 the game logic is implemented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a crash in a table process, the entire table must be rebuilt and the
 players must be re-associated with the table.
 Data concerning players is kept in the coordinator process, and is restored
 from there.
 Data kept in the actual game is not automatically corrupted by the crash
 in a table, however the table must be re-associated with the game VM is
 was associated with prior to the crash of the table.
 The table process maps well into the setting of the real-world chess club
 scenario previously discussed.
 A table works in the same way in a real world setting as in the GGS setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The game virtual machine module
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This module holds the game logic of a game and is responsible for the VM
 associated with each game.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The game VM contains the state of the VM and a table token associated with
 a running game.
 GameVM is started by the table module.
 The table module hands over a token to the game VM during initialization.
 During initialization a new VM instance and various objects associated
 to the VM instance will be created.
 Callbacks to Erlang are registered into the VM and then the source code
 of a game is loaded into the VM and the game is ready for startup.
 The only means for a game to communicate with the VM is through usage of
 a provided interface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VM itself makes it possible for the game developer to program in the
 programming language covered by the VM.
 In future releases, more game VMs will be added to support more programming
 languages.
 Because the game VM keeps track of the correct table, the game developer
 does not need to take this into consideration when programming a game.
 If a method within the game sends data to a player, it will be delivered
 to the player in the correct running game.
 The same game token is used to store the game state in the database.
 Therefore, no game states will be mixed up either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This module does not affect game runtime but evaluates a new game state
 and handles communication between the game and the players.
 A closer look at the structure of this model is given in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Communication-with-the-GDL-VM"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The code which is run in the VM is uploaded to the GGS prior to each game.
 Allowing the clients to upload code allows clients to run any game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The database module
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:The-database-module"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Game data from all games on the GGS are stored in the database backend of
 the database module.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the GGS prototype the database module is using a database management
 system called Mnesia.
 Mnesia ships with the standard Erlang distribution and is a key-value store
 type database.
 Mnesia is designed to handle the stress of telecoms systems, and has some
 features specifically tailored for telecoms which are not commonly found
 in other databases.
 Key features of the Mnesia database are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fast key/value lookups
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Distribution of the database system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fault tolerance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The features of Mnesia originally intended for telecoms prove very useful
 for the purposes of the GGS as well.
 The fault tolerance and speed of Mnesia are very valuable tools, the fast
 key/value lookups permit many lookups per second to the database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Game data will not be lost when a game is stopped or has gone down for unknown
 reasons.
 This makes it possible to continue a game just before the failure without
 having to start the game from the beginning.

\begin_layout Standard
The GGS stores the game state in the distributed Mnesia database, from which
 the state can be restored in the event of a crash.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each game is uniquely identified by a table token and the data of each game
 is stored within two different namespaces.
 The namespaces are named World and Localstorage.
 The World is used contain all game data related to the game state.
 This sort of game data may change during the runtime of the game.
 The Localstorage should contain data independent of the game state.
 Game resources, constants and global variables are all examples of data
 that could reside within the Localstorage.
 To store a value within the database, not only is the table token and the
 name of the namespace required, but a unique key so that the value can
 be successfully retrieved or modified later.
 The key is fully decidable by the game developer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interface of the database module is an implementation of the upcoming
 W3C Web Storage specification.
 Web Storage is intended for use in web browsers, providing a persistent
 storage on the local machine for web applications.
 The storage can be used to communicate in between browser windows (which
 is difficult when using cookies), and to store larger chunks of data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Usage of the web storage standard in the GGS provides a well documented
 interface to the database backend.

\begin_layout Section
Communication with the GDL VM
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Communication-with-the-GDL-VM"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A game launched on the GGS is run within a virtual machine.
 For each programming language supported, there is a virtual machine that
 interprets the game.
 Furthermore an interface for communication between the GGS, the game and
 the players playing the game is present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Callbacks written in Erlang are registered to the VM for the interface to
 work.
 It is only with the help of the interface that the game developer can access
 the game state and send messages to the clients.
 The interface provides access to three objects called 
\emph on
world, players
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
localStorage
\emph default
.
 The game state is safely stored in a database and retrieved for manipulation
 by a call for the world object.
 Interaction with the players is done by using the 
\emph on
GGS.sendCommand(player_id, command, args)
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
GGS.
\emph default
sendCommandToAll(command, args).
 The localstorage is a convenient way to store global data and other variables
 separated from the game state.
 Unique ids called gametokens are generated for hosted games so that they
 are not mixed up.

By linking processes together and notifying parents when children exit,
 supervisors are created.
 A supervisor is a common approach in ensuring that an application functions

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Savor:1997:HSA:851010.856089"

\end_inset

.
 When a process misbehaves, the supervisor takes some action to restore
 the process to a functional state.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several approaches to supervisor design in general (when not just
 considering how they work in Erlang).
 One common approach is to have the supervisor look in to the state of the
 process(es) it supervises, and let the supervisor make decisions based
 on this state.
 The supervisor has a specification of how the process it supervises should
 function, and this is how it makes decisions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Erlang, we have a simple version of supervisors.
 We do not inspect the state of the processes being supervised.
 We do have a specification of how the supervised processes should behave,
 but on a higher level.
 The specification describes things such as how many times in a given time
 interval a child process may crash, which processes need restarting when
 crashes occur, and so forth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the linking of processes in order to monitor exit behavior is coupled
 with the transparent distribution of Erlang, a very powerful supervision
 system is created.
 For instance, we can restart a failing process on a different, new node,
 with minimal impact on the system as a whole.

\begin_layout Standard
The graphic above shows our two subsystems, the coordinator subsystem and
 the dispatcher subsystem.
 Since these two systems perform very different tasks they have been separated.
 Each subsystem has one worker process, the coordinator or the dispatcher.
 The worker process keeps a state which should not be lost upon a crash.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have chosen to let faulty processes crash very easily when they receive
 bad data, or something unexpected happens.
 The alternative to crashing would have been to try and fix this faulty
 data, or to foresee the unexpected events.
 We chose not to do this because it is so simple to monitor and restart
 processes, and so difficult to try and mend broken states.
 This approach is something widely deployed in the Erlang world, and developers
 are often encouraged to “Let it crash”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To prevent any data loss, the good state of the worker processes is stored
 in their respective backup processes.
 When a worker process (re)starts, it asks the backup process for any previous
 state, if there is any that state is loaded in to the worker and it proceeds
 where it left off.
 If on the other hand no state is available, a special message is delivered
 instead, making the worker create a new state, this is what happens when
 the workers are first created.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Redundancy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The modules in the GGS are built to be capable of redundant operation.
 By adding a backup process to sensitive processes, the state can be kept
 in the event of a crash.
 The coordinator of the GGS prototype has this backup feature built in.
 The coordinator passes state along to the backup process which keeps the
 data safe.
 In the event of a crash, the coordinator recovers the state from the backup
 process.

Hot code replacement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hot code replacement is a technique used to update systems while they are
 running.
 The main use of hot code replacement are in critical systems that require
 low downtime, such as telecom systems.
 By using hot code replacement system can be able to achieve as high uptime
 as possible and thus improving the reliability of the system.
 Code replacement is a feature that exist in Erlang which means that with
 some work it could be implemented into the GGS.

Typical communication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This case study describes the flow through the GGS when a typical command
 is encountered.
 Consider a chat client sending the message to change the nick of a user.
 The actual code performing the change of a nick in JavaScript is discussed
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

.
 All communication between modules is asynchronous, nothing is blocking,
 which is very important in concurrent systems.
 It is probably much easier to follow the steps by following them on

\begin_layout Enumerate
The client packages a Game-Command into a package which conforms to the
 protocol structure the GGS is using and sends it over the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The player process, which is coupled to the TCP-process which reacts on
 incoming messages, accepts the message and forwards the raw data to the
 protocol parser process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The protocol parser process parses the message and brings it into the format
 of the internal GGS presentation of such a message, which is just a specialized
 Erlang tuple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The protocol parser sends this Erlang touple back to the player process.

The JavaScript VM (JSVM) - at this stage Googles V8 JavaScript Engine -
 evaluates the function within the sandboxed game context which has been
 established earlier during the setup of the game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the example in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 we see that the GGS-functions 
\emph on
GGS.localStorage.setItem(key, value)
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
GGS.localStorage(key)
\emph default
 are used.
 Both are callbacks coupled to the database module functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Data is being read from and written to the database and handed over to the
 JSVM via the database process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the example the 
\emph on
GGS.sendCommandToAll()
\emph default
 is being called then which is a callback to a function of the table module
 which iterates through its player list and sends the command to every player.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The table process sends every player process the message to send the message
 with the change of a nickname of a particular user to its own client.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The player process asks the protocol process to create a message conforming
 to the protocol which is being used.

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the message was just a plain

, without a table token, then the player process asks the coordinator process
 to create a new table process and add this player process to this newly
 created table.
 If the client did send a table token then the player process asks the coordinat
or to att the player process to this table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
During the creation of a new table the table process creates a new game
 VM process which creates its own game context within the JavaScript VM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The player process answers to the client with a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

hello
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to this table - or not and the table token it was assigned to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Defining a game
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the generic nature of the GGS it is the clients job to load up
 the source code of the game it would like to play.
 It is possible to alter the GGS prototype so that only the server maintainer
 is able to install new games on the server but this way the GGS is much
 more generic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first client which connects to a table is responsible to provide the
 JavaScript server source code.
 To do so there is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

define
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Server-Command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If during the handshake with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hello

 command the client gets the task of providing the server source code then
 it sends a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Server-Command message with the source code as its parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The player process parses, once again with help of the protocoll module,

\begin_layout Enumerate
The game VM process executes the source code within the JavaScript VM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The JavaScript VM evaluates the source code - which has to implement the
 playerCommand() function - within the games context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now the game is fully initialized and can be used by all clients with help
 of the playerCommand() function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The table process saves the source code in the database for backup reasons
 (this is not yet implemented).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The player process sends a

 Client-Command to the client.
 This way the client is notified that everything went well and it can start
 the game.

A GGS server application in JavaScript
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Example-of-a-GGS-app"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below is a concrete example of a simple chat server application written
 using the GGS.
 The language chosen for this chat server is JavaScript.
 The GGS processes all incoming data through a protocol parser, which interprets
 the data and parses it into an internal format for the GGS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the GGS receives a 
\emph on
Game-Command
\emph default
 from a client, it is passed along to the game VM through a function called
 
\emph on
playerCommand
\emph default
 which is the entry point for each game and has to be implemented by the
 developer; one can think of it like the 
\emph on
main()
\emph default
 function of a C or Java program
\emph on
.

\emph default
 Typically the 
\emph on
playerCommand
\emph default
 function contains conditional constructs which decide the next action to
 take.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:A-concrete-example"

\end_inset

 an example of the 
\emph on
playerCommand
\emph default
 function can be seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:A-concrete-example"

\end_inset

 the 
\emph on
playerCommand
\emph default
 function accepts two different commands.
 The first command is a command which allows chat clients connected to the
 chat server to change nicknames, which are used when chatting.
 In order to change the nickname, a client must send a Game-Command 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nick
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with the actual new nickname as a argument.
 When a message arrives to the GGS which has the form corresponding to the
 nickname change, the 
\emph on
playerCommand
\emph default
 function is called with the parameters 
\emph on
player_id, command, 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
args
\emph default
 filled in appropriately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
playerCommand
\emph default
 function is responsible for calling the helper functions responsibly for
 carrying out the actions of each message received.
 
\emph on
changeNick
\emph default
 is a function which is called when the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nick
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 message is received.
 The 
\emph on
changeNick 
\emph default
function uses a feature of the GGS called localstorage (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Communication-with-the-GDL-VM"

\end_inset

), which is an interface to the database backend contained in the database
 module (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:The-database-module"

\end_inset

).
 The database can be used as any key-value store, however the syntax for
 insertions and fetch operations is tightly integrated in the GDL of the
 GGS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Access to the localStorage is provided through the 
\emph on
GGS object
\emph default
, which also can be used to communicate with the rest of the system from
 the GDL.
 Implementation specifics of the GGS object are provided in

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter contains specific problems encountered when implementing the
 GGS prototype.
 Some of the problems described have solutions attached, however some problems
 were not solved, therefore only ideas for solutions have been attached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The integration of JavaScript as a GDL in the GGS prototype was particularly
 difficult, and is handled in this section.
 Unique identification is also handled, as is the design of the GGS protocol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
JavaScript engine
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GGS prototype uses a virtual machine to sandbox each game.
 JavaScript was chosen for the prototype due to its commonality in web applicati
ons and the flexibility of the language.
 Any language with the proper bindings to Erlang could have been used in
 theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two main JavaScript virtual machines, or 
\emph on
engines
\emph default
 available at the time of the writing of this thesis.
 There is a group of machines developed by Mozilla called 
\emph on
TraceMonkey, JaegerMonkey, SpiderMonkey 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
IonMonkey
\emph default
, and also there is Google V8.
 The group of Mozilla machines are largely the same, and are referred to
 as the same machine for simplicity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the Mozilla machines, there exists a Erlang binding called erlang_js,
 and for the V8 machine a binding called erlv8 exists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
erlang_js
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Erlang_js provides direct communication with the JavaScript VM.
 Which is exactly what is desired, however also required is thee possibility
 to communicate from erlang_js to Erlang.
 The ability to communicate from JavaScript to Erlang functionality is not
 yet implemented in erlang_js, due to lack of time on the behalf of the
 erlang_js developers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were two possible solutions to the problem of the JavaScript to Erlang
 communication path missing, the path could be implemented by the GGS project,
 or a switch from erlang_js for some other JavaScript engine could be made.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Attempts at creating the communication path from JavaScript to Erlang were
 initially made, however the communication path never became stable enough
 for usage in the GGS and the erlang_js software was abandoned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
erlv8
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
erlv8 is powered by the V8 engine developed by Google rather than the engines
 developed by Mozilla.
 The ability to communicate with Erlang from JavaScript using callbacks
 is available in the erlv8 bindings, therefore this feature does not have
 to be added to the bindings in order to be used in the GGS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initial releases of the erlv8 bindings had stability issues, these were
 however solved by the erlv8 developers during the usage of erlv8 in the
 GGS.
 erlv8 is the JavaScript engine powering JavaScript as a GDL in the GGS.

UUID 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Erlang identifies processes uniquely throughout the Erlang network using
 process IDs (PID).
 When we wish to refer to erlang processes from outside our erlang system,
 for example in a virtual machine for a different language, possibly on
 a different machine, these PIDs are no longer useful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This problem is not new, and a common solution is to use a Universally Unique
 Identifier, a UUID.
 These identifiers are generated both using randomization and using time.
 A reasonably large number of UUIDs can be generated before a collision
 should occur.
 There are standard tools in many UNIX systems to generate UUIDs, we chose
 to use the uuidgen command, which employs an equidistributed combined Tausworth
e generator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Protocol design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initially the GGS protocol was designed to use the UDP protocol for transport.
 Due to the lack of error checking in the UDP protocol, the UDP protocol
 is faster than the TCP protocol, this was a main reason to use UDP.
 The GGS does however need error checking to be as reliable as possible,
 therefore an error checking layer would have to be placed on top of UDP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The development of an error checking layer was weighed against the implementatio
n of TCP instead of UDP, thus losing some speed.
 Even though speed was lost, TCP was chosen due to the relative ease of
 implementation compared to UDP.
 Due to the modularity of the GGS, a UDP extension is possible by replacing
 the network parts of the GGS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, in a move to increase the speed of the GGS protocol the binary
 BSON protocol 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bson:website"

\end_inset

 was initially considered.
 BSON is a protocol which can be used for very fast traversal of data.
 The BSON protocol is however rather difficult to read in its plain format,
 and no implementation has been bade for the GGS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Apache Thrift 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Slee2007"

\end_inset

 was also an alternative.
 Using Thrift would mean the GGS would feature a standard protocol for network
 communication.
 Before finding out about Thrift, an implementation of the GGS protocol
 had already been made, moving to Thrift would mean too much work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of Thrift, BSON, or other protocols can be supported quite easily
 by developing protocol modules for each protocol.
 No protocol modules for these protocols have however been developed during
 the writing of this thesis

There was also a testing session where the number of clients were measured,
 however this was not a good measurement of performance and therefore these
 numbers will not be included in the report.

The hardware that the GGS was running on was a Thinkpad T410, with a Intel
 i5 processor and 4GB of RAM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first test, where Mnesia was used, the server had a peak value of
 nearly 6000 messages per second.
 When this number was reached Mnesia warned that it was overloaded and shortly
 after that Mnesia failed to serve requests.
 This result was not unexpected as this test put the database under heavy
 load.
 In the next testing session, the test was conducted with another client
 that did not use Mnesia.
 Without mnesia the server peaked at 60000 messages per second, however
 this was only for a very short time.
 The average throughput was around 25000 messages per second, five times
 more than what the server was able to process with Mnesia in place.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second testing session the delay between the server and clients was
 also measured.
 A connection can be seen between those values, as long as the server is
 under moderate load the delay is low and stable.
 When the load on the server increases heavily the delay does the same,
 this is because the server can not process all incoming messages and therefore
 messages are put in a queue within the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Important things to note are that the number of clients is not a good way
 of measuring the performance of the server because the server is possible
 to have a large number of clients on the server but it can not handle all
 the information.
 Instead the performance of the server should be measured in the number
 of messages it can handle per second.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We were able to reach 6000 messages per second on the server, which corresponds
 to around 350 clients.
 However soon after this mnesia printed some warnings and the clients started
 to lag.
 With this in mind one thing to investigate is if mnesia is the bottleneck
 in the system.
 Current game servers do not use databases to save their state and maybe
 we can see the reason here.
 Other possible bottlenecks may be the protocol, but this seems less likely
 than mnesia.

\begin_layout Section
Future improvements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several things in the GGS that can be improved.
 In this section the most important additions to the GGS are described,
 along with a motivation as to why these additions are not found in the
 GGS prototype.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GGS was originally intended to be a distributed application, running
 on several machines at once.
 The design of the GGS should support this, it has however not been tested.
 The technologies, such as supervisor trees and the servers supplied by
 the OTP which are used in the GGS all support the development of distributed
 applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Distribution was however not implemented in the GGS.
 Other parts of the GGS were prioritized.
 A futute improvement is therefore to implement distribution in the GGS.
 A simple way to achieve this is to keep one GGS instance as a coordinating
 instance, and to keep clients on other instances of the GGS, which can
 be dynamically added as new clients connect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Protocols
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Need references for assertions about UDP being nicer on the CPU.
 Motivate why UDP is not implemented.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of TCP being a connection oriented protocol, it is not suited for
 all types of game data transfers.
 Each transmission will consume more network bandwidth than connectionless
 protocols like UDP and cause unnecessary load on the processor.
 Therefore support for UDP would mean that more games could be run simultaneousl
y on the GGS.
 Another advantage of UDP is latency being reduced.
 Without having to setup a connection for each group packets of data being
 sent, they will be sent instantly and therefore arrive earlier.
 Latency is of highest importance in real-time games as it improves realism
 and fairness in gameplay and many game developers require the freedom to
 take care of safety issues as packet losses themselves.
 This concludes that UDP would be a benefit for the GGS, game developers
 and players alike.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Database
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently Mnesia is used for game data storage.
 During stress tests, Mnesia has turned out to be the bottleneck due to
 data losses when too many games are played on the GGS simultaneously.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The usage of Mnesia in the GGS is not the usage originally intended.
 Originally a cache was to be placed before Mnesia.
 The cache could be either Erlang Term Storage (ETS) or an Erlang process
 which keeps track of all database actions.
 The cache periodically flushes its contents to Mnesia, thereby reducing
 the Mnesia transactions overall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cache was never implemented in the prototype due to other parts of the
 GGS being prioritized.
 The current implementation of the database backend is not optimal, however
 it functions reliably, therefore it was deemed sufficient for the prototype.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible future addition to the GGS could be to add this cache in the
 database module.
 The API would not need to change, as this could be implemented internally
 in the database module.

\begin_layout Subsection
Documentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start the GGS is not self explanatory.
 This together with overall usage of GGS should be documented.
 The interface for usage of game developers are also in need of documentation.
 Features and requirements with respect to the GGS would assist users to
 know what they need to use the GGS and how they would benefit of it.
 The GGS does not support many programming languages nor does it have a
 complete documentation.
 This needs to be taken care of in future versions.
